# LSFR-Crypto-Maki-" 
Inspiration from Cryptography Lecture on Stream Ciphers and specifically the generation of number in Linear Feedback Shift Registers.

[x] 8 bit seed used to generate random numbers up to 255 bits.
[x] Decrypt and Encrypt Messages
# Disadvantage
--> The Stream Cipher Determines all possible 'random' numbers given the seed, which is not practical with big keys.
