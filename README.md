# LSFR-Crypto-Maki-" 
Inspiration from Cryptography Lecture on Stream Ciphers and specifically the generation of number in Linear Feedback Shift Registers.  
--> 8 bit seed used to generate random numbers up to 255 bits    
--> Decrypt and Encrypt Messages    
Disadvantage  
--> The Stream Cipher Determines all possible 'random' numbers given the seed rather than generating random bits when needed, which is not practical with big keys with 2^128 possible outcomes.
